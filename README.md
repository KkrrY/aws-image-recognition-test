## üß† Overview

This project is built using a modern stack and a well-structured architecture:

- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.1.3
- **Frontend**: Angular 19.2.8

The backend follows a **modular monolith** design-merging the simplicity of a monolithic deployment with the clarity and flexibility of modular design. Each module encapsulates a distinct domain responsibility and interacts via clean interfaces, making the system more maintainable and scalable over time.
